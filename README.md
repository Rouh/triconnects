New Social Network for increase the quality of academic and industry job searching for students, faculties and employers.
Every year the students and graduates all over the world apply for colleges and universities to earn higher graduate degree and build their future carrier. As faculty and former student, we know how important it is for both students and faculties to find their matched candidates. However, this process is cumbersome and time consuming due to the traditional way of connection, Emails!.
 According to our statistics, professors receive more than 200 emails per day from potential candidates during application session. However faculties don’t have enough time to look over all the emails and CVs of each student. This highly reduces the chance of many qualified candidates who would be interested to work with their favorite research groups. 
Beside of spending many hours on searching for openings in research groups all over the world, students should interact with others to find out many unknown questions during application process such as what documentation you need for application, required scores, chance of getting admitted. This needs few month of preparation before applying for universities.
On the other hand,  graduate/postdoc opening have no time limitation and might be available any time of year. This bring many problems for faculties when searching for qualified candidate especially in low application season in which applicants are already accept their new positions and professors need to get updates on status of the potential applicants. 
To increase the quality of academic and industry job searching for students we as postdoc/professor and former students believe our new website can address all these problems and facilitate this process for all parties.
